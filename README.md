flip-the-tables
===============

flip-the-tables is yet another ruby version switcher, in the vein of [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/) and
[rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). The philosophy of flip-the-tables is that choosing ruby
versions should be a trivial task best solved in the simplest manner possible. It was partially inspired by
[this blog post](http://chris.mowforth.com/si-because-rvm-and-rbenv-are-overkill).
